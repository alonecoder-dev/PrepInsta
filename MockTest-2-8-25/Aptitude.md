# The number of trees in a town is 4293. If the numbers of trees increase annually at the rate of 12.5%, then how many trees were there 2 years ago?

2561

2738

3927

3392

The present number of trees = 4293
Annual growth rate = 12.5% = 1/8

1. Growth factor per year
1 + 12.5% = 1 + 1/8 = 9/8
2. Growth factor for 2 years
(9/8)²
3. Let the number of trees 2 years ago be N.
N × (9/8)² = 4293
N = 4293 × (8/9)²

(8/9)² = 64/81

4293 = 81 × 53
So, N = (81 × 53) × (64/81) = 53 × 64 = 3392

Therefore, the town had 3392 trees two years ago.

Answer: 3392

# The distance between two places P and Q is 320km. A car runs from P to Q at a speed of 68km/h, while another car runs from Q to P at a speed of 72km/h. what will be the distance between the two cars (in km) 6 minutes before they meet?

14km

18km

26km

10km

Relative (closing) speed of the two cars
= 68 km/h + 72 km/h = 140 km/h

Distance they are still apart t hours before they meet
= relative speed × t

6 minutes = 6/60 = 0.1 hour

Distance 6 minutes (0.1 h) before meeting
= 140 km/h × 0.1 h = 14 km

Hence, the two cars are 14 km apart 6 minutes before they meet.

Answer: 14 km

# The successive discount of 20%, 10% and 8% is equivalent to a single discount of:

66.24%

32.84%

38%

33.76%

To find the single discount equivalent to successive discounts of 20%, 10% and 8%, multiply the remaining price factors for each discount and then convert the result back to a percentage.

1. Convert each discount to its “pay” factor
20% off  → pay 80%  → 0.80
10% off  → pay 90%  → 0.90
8% off   → pay 92%  → 0.92
2. Multiply the factors to get the overall pay factor
0.80 × 0.90 × 0.92 = 0.6624
3. Equivalent single discount
Discount = 1 − 0.6624 = 0.3376 = 33.76%

Therefore, the three successive discounts are together equal to a single discount of 33.76%.

Answer: 33.76%

# Abhinav and Babita started their journeys from Delhi to Jaipur and Jaipur to Delhi, respectively. After crossing each other, Abhinav and Babita completed remaining parts of their journeys in

9
4/5

hours and 5 hours, respectively. If the speed of Abhinav is 45 km/h, then the speed of Babita (in km/h) is:

65km/h

56km/h

61km/h

63km/h

Let
Abhinav’s speed = v₁ = 45 km/h
Babita’s speed = v₂ km/h (to be found)
t  = time taken by each of them before they meet (hours)
T₁ = Abhinav’s time after meeting = 9 4⁄5 h = 9.8 h
T₂ = Babita’s time after meeting  = 5 h

1. Distance Abhinav still has to cover after the meeting
= distance Babita had already covered before the meeting
= v₂ · t

v₂ · t = v₁ · T₁ = 45 × 9.8 ……… (1)
2. Distance Babita still has to cover after the meeting
= distance Abhinav had already covered before the meeting
= v₁ · t

v₁ · t = v₂ · T₂ = v₂ × 5 ……… (2)

From (2): t = (v₂ × 5) / v₁ = (5 v₂) / 45

Substitute t in (1):

v₂ × (5 v₂ / 45) = 45 × 9.8
(5 v₂²) / 45 = 441  ( because 45 × 9.8 = 441 )
v₂² = 441 × (45 / 5) = 441 × 9 = 3969
v₂ = √3969 = 63 km/h

Therefore, Babita’s speed is 63 km/h.

Answer: 63 km/h

# A shopkeeper sold two articles for Rs 9639 each. On one, he gained 19% and on the other, he lost 19%. What is the overall percentage gain or loss?

3.81% loss

3.61% gain

3.81% gain

3.61% loss

Let the common selling price (SP) for each article be Rs 9639.

1. Article 1 (19% gain)
If the gain is 19%, then
SP = CP × (1 + 19⁄100) ⇒ CP₁ = 9639 / 1.19
2. Article 2 (19% loss)
If the loss is 19%, then
SP = CP × (1 – 19⁄100) ⇒ CP₂ = 9639 / 0.81
3. Total cost price
CP₁ + CP₂ = 9639 (1/1.19 + 1/0.81)

1/1.19 = 100/119 , 1/0.81 = 100/81

CP_total = 9639 (100/119 + 100/81)
= 9639 × 100 (1/119 + 1/81)
= 963900 × (81 + 119) / (119 × 81)
= 963900 × 200 / 9639
= 20000
4. Total selling price
SP_total = 2 × 9639 = 19278
5. Overall result
Loss = CP_total – SP_total = 20000 – 19278 = 722

Percentage loss = (722 / 20000) × 100 = 3.61%

Hence the shopkeeper incurs an overall loss of 3.61%.

Answer: 3.61% loss

# A shopkeeper sold two articles for Rs. 9,879 each. On one, he gained 11% and on the other, he lost 11%. What is the overall percentage gain or loss?

1.21% loss

1.21% gain

1.25% loss

1.25% gain

Let the common selling price (SP) of each article be Rs 9 879.

Article 1: sold at 11% gain
SP = CP₁ × 1.11  ⇒  CP₁ = 9 879 / 1.11

Article 2: sold at 11% loss
SP = CP₂ × 0.89  ⇒  CP₂ = 9 879 / 0.89

Total cost price
CP₁ + CP₂ = 9 879 (1/1.11 + 1/0.89)

Note that
1/1.11 = 100/111, 1/0.89 = 100/89, and 111 × 89 = 9 879.

Therefore
CP_total = 9 879 × 100 (1/111 + 1/89)
= 9 879 × 100 × (89 + 111)/(111 × 89)
= 9 879 × 100 × 200 / 9 879
= 20 000

Total selling price
SP_total = 2 × 9 879 = 19 758

Overall result
Loss = CP_total – SP_total = 20 000 – 19 758 = 242

Percentage loss
= (242 / 20 000) × 100 = 1.21%

Hence, the shopkeeper incurs an overall loss of 1.21%.

Answer: 1.21% loss

# A shopkeeper marks the price of an article such that after giving a discount of 30%, he gains 20%. If the marked price of the article is Rs. 480, what is the cost price of the article?

Rs. 280

Rs. 300

Rs. 250

Rs. 260

A 30% discount on the marked price (MP) of Rs 480 gives the selling price (SP):

SP = 480 × (1 − 0.30) = 480 × 0.70 = Rs 336.

The shopkeeper makes a 20% gain on cost price (CP):

SP = CP × (1 + 0.20) = CP × 1.20
CP = SP / 1.20 = 336 / 1.20 = Rs 280.

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs 280.

Answer: Rs. 280

# The successive discounts of 30%, 25% and 15% is equivalent to a single discount of:

60.275%

54.625%

55.375%

60.725%

For successive discounts, multiply the “pay” factors left after each discount and then convert back to a single overall discount.

1. Convert each discount to its pay factor
30% off → pay 70%  → 0.70
25% off → pay 75%  → 0.75
15% off → pay 85%  → 0.85
2. Multiply the factors
Overall pay factor = 0.70 × 0.75 × 0.85
= 0.525 × 0.85
= 0.44625
3. Convert to a single discount
Equivalent discount = 1 − 0.44625
= 0.55375 = 55.375%

Therefore, the three successive discounts are together equal to a single discount of 55.375%.

Answer: 55.375%

# The single discount equivalent to two successive discounts of 12% and 8% is: (rounded off)

18%

19%

20%

17%

Each discount leaves a “pay” factor that is actually charged:

12% off  → pay 88% → 0.88
8%  off  → pay 92% → 0.92

Successive discounts:
Overall pay factor = 0.88 × 0.92 = 0.8096

Equivalent single discount = 1 − 0.8096 = 0.1904 = 19.04%

Rounded to the nearest whole percent, the single-discount equivalent is 19%.

Answer: 19%

# A trader marks the products 25% above the cost price and allows a discount of 15%. If the cost price is Rs 2080, then the selling price is:

Rs 2210

Rs 2392

Rs 2600

Rs 1809

The product is first marked 25% above cost and then sold with a 15% discount.

1. Marked price (MP)
MP = CP × 1.25
= 2080 × 1.25
= 2080 + 520
= Rs 2600
2. Selling price (SP) after 15% discount
SP = MP × (1 – 0.15)
= 2600 × 0.85
= 2210

Selling price = Rs 2210

Answer: Rs 2210

# A manufacturer sells the product to a wholesaler at 6% profit, the wholesaler sells the product to a retailer at 8% profit and the retailer sells the product to his customer at 10% profit. The price paid by the customer is Rs 31482. The cost of the product to the manufacturer is :

Rs 26524

Rs 25000

Rs 26980

Rs 28306

Let

CP₀ = manufacturer’s own cost price (what we need)
SP₀ = manufacturer’s selling price to the wholesaler
SP₁ = wholesaler’s selling price to the retailer
SP₂ = retailer’s selling price to the customer = Rs 31 482

Given profit chain
Manufacturer → Wholesaler : +6%
Wholesaler   → Retailer   : +8%
Retailer     → Customer   : +10%

Work backwards from the final price.

1. Retailer’s cost (what he paid the wholesaler)
SP₂ = CP₁ × 1.10
CP₁ = 31 482 / 1.10 = 28 620
2. Wholesaler’s cost (what he paid the manufacturer)
CP₁ = SP₀ × 1.08
SP₀ = 28 620 / 1.08 = 26 500
3. Manufacturer’s cost price
SP₀ = CP₀ × 1.06
CP₀ = 26 500 / 1.06 = 25 000

Therefore the manufacturer’s cost of the product is Rs 25 000.

Answer: Rs 25 000

# A mobile cover costing Rs. 264 is available at a discount of 12%. What would be the selling price of 4 such mobile covers?

Rs. 936.72

Rs. 929.28

Rs. 940.46

Rs. 934.04

Marked price of one cover = Rs 264
Discount = 12% ⇒ Pay factor = 100% − 12% = 88% = 0.88

Selling price of one cover
= 264 × 0.88
= 232.32

For 4 covers
= 232.32 × 4
= 929.28

Selling price of 4 mobile covers = Rs 929.28

Answer: Rs. 929.28

# A trader marks the cost of a car 24% above its price and allows a discount of 15%. If the discount is Rs. 2,23,200, then the cost price of the car is:

Rs. 11,60,000

Rs. 15,80,000

Rs. 14,25,000

Rs. 12,00,000

Let

CP = cost price
MP = marked price
Discount rate = 15%
Discount amount = Rs 2,23,200

1. Discount amount = 15% of MP
MP = 2,23,200 ÷ 0.15 = 1,488,000
2. The marked price is 24% above cost:
MP = CP × (1 + 24/100) = CP × 1.24

CP = MP / 1.24
= 1,488,000 / 1.24
= 1,488,000 × 25/31
= 48,000 × 25
= 12,00,000

Cost price of the car = Rs 12,00,000

Answer: Rs. 12,00,000

# The marked price of a dress is Rs 2,340 which is 25% above the cost price. If the dress is sold at a profit of 10%, the profit earned on the dress is:

Rs 234

Rs 187.20

Rs 197

Rs 175.50

The marked price (MP) is 25% above the cost price (CP).

1. Find the cost price
MP = CP × 1.25
CP = 2340 / 1.25 = 1872
2. Selling price at 10% profit
SP = CP × 1.10 = 1872 × 1.10 = 2059.20
3. Profit earned
Profit = SP − CP = 2059.20 − 1872 = 187.20

Profit on the dress = Rs 187.20

# The price of a refrigerator is Rs 22,000. A shopkeeper marks its price 15% above its cost price and gives a discount of 8%. The discount is:

Rs 1,960

Rs 1,824

Rs 1,672

Rs 2,024

The given price of the refrigerator (Rs 22,000) is its cost price (C.P.).

1. Marked price (M.P.)
M.P. = C.P. × (1 + 15%)
= 22,000 × 1.15
= Rs 25,300
2. Discount allowed
Discount = 8% of M.P.
= 0.08 × 25,300
= Rs 2,024

Hence the discount given is Rs 2,024.

Answer: Rs 2,024

# Two numbers are respectively 12.5% and 25% more than a 3rd number. The first number as a percentage of the second number is:

50 %

60%

75 %

90%

Let the third number be x.

First number = x + 12.5% of x
= x(1 + 0.125)
= 1.125 x

Second number = x + 25% of x
= x(1 + 0.25)
= 1.25 x

Percentage that the first number is of the second:

(1.125 x / 1.25 x) × 100
= (1.125 / 1.25) × 100

# If the price of potatoes is reduced by 25%, one can buy 6.25kg more for Rs.100. The reduced price of potatoes is:

Rs. 3 per kg

Rs. 3.50 per kg

Rs. 4 per kg

Rs. 4.50 per kg

Let the original price be Rs x per kg.

After a 25% reduction the new price = 0.75 x rupees per kg.

With Rs 100 one can buy

- before the reduction: 100 / x kg
- after the reduction: 100 / (0.75 x) = 400 / (3 x) kg

The extra quantity obtainable is 6.25 kg:

400 / (3 x) − 100 / x = 6.25

Convert to a common denominator:

[400 − 300] / (3 x) = 6.25
100 / (3 x) = 6.25
3 x = 100 / 6.25 = 16
x = 16 / 3 = 5.33̅ rupees per kg (original price)

Reduced price = 0.75 x = 0.75 × 16⁄3 = 4 rupees per kg.

Answer: Rs. 4 per kg

# John spends 75% of his salary. If his salary is increased by 21% and his saving is increased by 16% then by how much percentage his expenditure will increase?

21.9%

22.6%

20.2%

19.8%

Let the original salary be Rs S.

Original situation

- Expenditure = 75% of S = 0.75 S
- Savings      = 25% of S = 0.25 S

After the rises

1. Salary rises by 21%
New salary, S₁ = 1.21 S
2. Savings rise by 16%
New savings = 0.25 S × 1.16 = 0.29 S

New expenditure
E₁ = S₁ − (new savings)
= 1.21 S − 0.29 S
= 0.92 S

Increase in expenditure
ΔE = E₁ − E = 0.92 S − 0.75 S = 0.17 S

Percentage increase
(ΔE / E) × 100 = (0.17 S / 0.75 S) × 100
= (0.17 / 0.75) × 100
≈ 22.67% ≈ 22.6%

Therefore, John’s expenditure increases by about 22.6%.

Answer: 22.6%

# Ram started working on a project. If his work-time per day is increased by 8% and salary per hour increased by 50%, then by how much percent his daily income would be increased?

58%

62%

63%

53%

Let

- original working hours per day = H
- original wage per hour = R

Original daily income = H × R

After the changes

- Hours become H × (1 + 8%) = 1.08 H
- Wage becomes R × (1 + 50%) = 1.50 R

New daily income = 1.08 H × 1.50 R = 1.62 (H R)

Increase factor = 1.62
Percentage increase = (1.62 − 1) × 100 = 0.62 × 100 = 62%

Therefore, Ram’s daily income rises by 62%.

# A saves 12% of her income If she spends Rs.2,16,128, her total income is:

Rs.2,42,063

Rs.2,45,600

Rs.2,48,000

Rs.2,43,560

Saving % = 12%  ⇒  Spending % = 100% − 12% = 88%

Spending amount = Rs 2,16,128 = 88% of income

Income = 2,16,128 ÷ 0.88
= 2,16,128 × (25 / 22)
= 9,824 × 25

# The speed of a car increases by 2 km/h after every one hour. If the distance travelled in the first one hour was 35 km, what was the total distance travelled in 12 hours?

558 km

650 km

560 km

552 km

The car covers exactly one hour at each speed, starting with 35 km/h and increasing by 2 km/h every subsequent hour.

Speeds for the 12 hours:

35, 37, 39, … , 35 + 2(11) = 57 km/h

This is an arithmetic series with
first term a₁ = 35, last term a₁₂ = 57, number of terms n = 12.

Total distance = sum of speeds × 1 h
= n/2 × (first + last)
= 12/2 × (35 + 57)
= 6 × 92
= 552 km

Hence, the car travels 552 km in 12 hours.

Answer: 552 km

# A boy increases his speed to

9
/5

​
﻿ times of his original speed. By this, he reaches his school 30 minutes before the usual time. How much time does he takes usually?

67.50 minutes

67.10 minutes

67.75 minutes

67.25 minutes

Let the usual time be T minutes and the usual speed be v.

When he increases his speed to 9/5 v, the time taken becomes

T ′ = distance / (9/5 v) = (5/9) · (distance / v) = (5/9) T.

Time saved = T – T ′ = T – (5/9) T = (4/9) T.

This saving equals 30 minutes:

(4/9) T = 30
T = 30 × (9/4) = 30 × 2.25 = 67.5 minutes.

Therefore, the boy usually takes 67.50 minutes.

Answer: 67.50 minutes

# A train starts from Jaipur at 9:00 am and reaches Delhi at 3:00 pm. Another train starts from Delhi at 11:00 am and reaches jaipur4:00 pm. Find the meeting time.

12: 40 pm

12: 20 pm

12:36 pm

12:49 pm

Let the Jaipur–Delhi distance be D km.

Train A (Jaipur → Delhi)

- Departs 9 : 00 am, arrives 3 : 00 pm
- Time taken = 6 h ⇒ speed v₁ = D/6 km/h

Train B (Delhi → Jaipur)

- Departs 11 : 00 am, arrives 4 : 00 pm
- Time taken = 5 h ⇒ speed v₂ = D/5 km/h

1. Distance covered by Train A before Train B starts
From 9 : 00 am to 11 : 00 am (2 h):
d = v₁ × 2 = (D/6) × 2 = D/3

Distance still separating them at 11 : 00 am
= D − D/3 = 2D/3
2. Relative speed after 11 : 00 am
v₁ + v₂ = D/6 + D/5 = 11D/30 km/h
3. Time required to close the remaining gap
t = (2D/3) ÷ (11D/30)
= (2/3) × (30/11)
= 20/11 h = 1 h 49 min (approx)
4. Meeting time
11 : 00 am + 1 h 49 min ≈ 12 : 49 pm

Hence the two trains meet at about 12 : 49 pm.

Answer: 12 : 49 pm

# Two trains having same length cross an electric pole in 33 secs and 30 secs respectively. Then, in how much time they will cross each other if they are moving in opposite directions?

13.7 secs

31.4 secs

9.8 secs

15.6 secs

Let the (common) length of each train be L metres.

Speed of first train
v₁ = L / 33 m s⁻¹            (because it takes 33 s to pass a pole)

Speed of second train
v₂ = L / 30 m s⁻¹            (because it takes 30 s to pass a pole)

When the trains move in opposite directions their relative speed is

v₁ + v₂ = L/33 + L/30
= L(30 + 33) / (33 × 30)
= 63L / 990
= 7L / 110  m s⁻¹.

To cross each other they must cover a total distance equal to the sum of their lengths, i.e. 2L.

Time required
t = distance / relative speed
= 2L / (7L / 110)
= 2 × 110 / 7
= 220 / 7 ≈ 31.4 seconds.

Therefore, the two trains will cross each other in about 31.4 s.

Answer: 31.4 seconds

# Two persons are travelling towards each other from point A and B. The distance between A and B is 50 km. It takes 8Hr to meet them. If the speed of person travelling from A is 4 km/h then what will be the speed of another person?

1.75km/h

2.5 km/h

1.50km/h

2.25km/h

Let

distance AB = 50 km
speed of person from A = 4 km/h
speed of person from B = v km/h
meeting time = 8 h

Because they walk toward each other, their relative speed is 4 + v km/h.

Distance = Relative speed × Time
50 = (4 + v) × 8
4 + v = 50 / 8 = 6.25
v = 6.25 − 4 = 2.25 km/h

Hence the speed of the second person is 2.25 km/h.

Answer: 2.25 km/h

# Two cars are running on parallel tracks in the same direction at the speed of 50 km/h and 40 km/h respectively. The cars crossed each other in 3 minutes. If the length of one cars in 175m then what is the length of the other car?

300 m

275 m

375 m

325 m

Relative speed (because both cars move in the same direction)

= 50 km/h − 40 km/h = 10 km/h
= 10 × 1000 / 3600 m/s = 2.777… m/s

Time taken to overtake = 3 min = 180 s

For an overtake, distance covered at the relative speed equals the sum of the two lengths:

(sum of lengths) = relative speed × time
= 2.777… m/s × 180 s
= 500 m

Let L be the length of the other car.
Given one car is 175 m long:

175 + L = 500
L = 500 − 175 = 325 m

Length of the other car: 325 m

# A wheel has diameter of 42 cm, then how far does the wheel go (in meters) in 16 revolutions?

19m

20.02m

21.12m

25m

The distance covered in one revolution equals the circumference of the wheel.

1. Diameter = 42 cm ⇒ radius r = 21 cm
Circumference = 2πr = 2 × π × 21 = 42π cm
Using π ≈ 22/7:
Circumference = 42 × 22/7 = 132 cm
2. Distance in 16 revolutions
= 132 cm × 16 = 2 112 cm
3. Convert to metres
2 112 cm ÷ 100 = 21.12 m

Hence, the wheel travels 21.12 metres in 16 revolutions.

Answer: 21.12 m

# The efficiencies of A, B and C are in the ratio 4 : 5 : 6. Working together, they can complete a work in 12 days. In how many days will A alone be able to complete that work?

45

36

30

40

Let the daily work rates (efficiencies) of A, B and C be proportional to 4 : 5 : 6.

Take them as:
A = 4x units/day
B = 5x units/day
C = 6x units/day

Combined rate = 4x + 5x + 6x = 15x units/day.

Working together they finish the whole job in 12 days, so

Total work = (15x units/day) × 12 days = 180x units.

Time for A alone = (total work) ÷ (A’s rate)
= 180x ÷ 4x
= 45 days.

Therefore, A alone would take 45 days to do the work.

Answer: 45

# 24 persons working 8 hrs a day can complete 2 units of a work in 10 days. How many persons are required to complete 4 units of that work, if they work 6 hours a day for 16 days?

48

36

40

32

Work is directly proportional to the total person-hours put in.

Step 1:  Find the person-hours needed per unit of work
24 persons × 8 h/day × 10 days = 1 920 person-hours produce 2 units
⇒ Person-hours per unit = 1 920 / 2 = 960

Step 2:  Person-hours required for 4 units
4 units × 960 = 3 840 person-hours

Step 3:  Hours one person can give under the new schedule
6 h/day × 16 days = 96 hours per person

Step 4:  Number of persons needed
Persons = total person-hours / hours per person
= 3 840 / 96 = 40

Therefore, 40 persons are required.

# 6 men or 5 women earn Rs 14820 in two days. How much will 4 women and 6 men earn in one day?

Rs 27,664

Rs 26,676

Rs 13,338

Rs 13,832

6 men (working 2 days) earn Rs 14 820
⇒ daily earning of 6 men = 14 820 ÷ 2 = Rs 7 410
⇒ daily earning of 1 man = 7 410 ÷ 6 = Rs 1 235

5 women (working 2 days) earn Rs 14 820
⇒ daily earning of 5 women = 14 820 ÷ 2 = Rs 7 410
⇒ daily earning of 1 woman = 7 410 ÷ 5 = Rs 1 482

Earning in one day for 4 women and 6 men:

4 women: 4 × 1 482 = Rs 5 928
6 men : 6 × 1 235 = Rs 7 410
Total   = 5 928 + 7 410 = Rs 13 338

Answer: Rs 13,338

1/6
th﻿ of the same work in 5 days. In how many days they can finish the work, if they work together?

12

A’s work rate
A completes 1/5 of the work in 4 days
⇒ daily rate of A = (1/5) ÷ 4 = 1/20 work per day
⇒ A alone would finish the whole work in 20 days.

B’s work rate
B completes 1/6 of the work in 5 days
⇒ daily rate of B = (1/6) ÷ 5 = 1/30 work per day
⇒ B alone would finish the whole work in 30 days.

Combined rate
A + B = 1/20 + 1/30
= (3 + 2)/60
= 5/60
= 1/12 work per day.

Time for both together to finish the work
= 1 ÷ (1/12)
= 12 days.

Answer: 12

# A and B can finish a work together in 30 days. B and C can finish the same work together in 24 and A and C can finish the work together in 40 days. If all three work together, how long will it take them to complete the work?

15 days

10 days

20 days

5 days

Let the daily work rates of A, B and C be a, b and c (fraction of the job per day).

Given
a + b = 1/30
b + c = 1/24
a + c = 1/40

Add the three equations:

(a + b) + (b + c) + (a + c) = 1/30 + 1/24 + 1/40
2(a + b + c) = 1/30 + 1/24 + 1/40

Find the right-hand sum using the LCM 120:

1/30 = 4/120
1/24 = 5/120
1/40 = 3/120

Sum = (4 + 5 + 3)/120 = 12/120 = 1/10

So,

2(a + b + c) = 1/10
a + b + c = 1/20

Hence, working together they complete 1/20 of the job per day, i.e. the whole job in

1 ÷ (1/20) = 20 days.

Answer: 20 days

# If A had worked alone, he would have taken 63 hours to do the task. What is B’s share, if A and B together on a task finishing it in 36 hours and they get paid Rs. 5,950 for it?

3600

3400

2750

2550

A’s time alone = 63 h
⇒ A’s work-rate = 1/63 job per hour

Together A + B finish in 36 h
⇒ (A + B) work-rate = 1/36 job per hour

Let B’s rate be r_B:

1/63 + r_B = 1/36
r_B = 1/36 − 1/63
= 7/252 − 4/252
= 3/252 = 1/84 job per hour

Work done in 36 h

- by A: 36 × 1/63 = 36/63 = 4/7 of the job
- by B: 36 × 1/84 = 36/84 = 3/7 of the job

The payment (Rs 5 950) is shared in the same ratio.

B’s share = (3/7) × 5 950
= 850 × 3
= Rs 2 550

Answer: Rs 2 550
